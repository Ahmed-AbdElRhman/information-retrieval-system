Due to the developments in computer technology and its increase in popularity, large numbers of people have recently started to frequently search huge databases. For example, internet search engines are frequently used to search the entire world wide web. Currently, a popular search engine might execute over 30 million searches per day of the indexable part of the web, which has a size in excess of 500 Gigabytes. Information retrieval systems are traditionally judged by their precision and recall. What is often neglected, however, is the quality of the results produced by these search engines. Large databases of documents such as the web contain many low quality documents. As a result, searches typically return hundreds of irrelevant or unwanted documents which camouflage the few relevant ones. In order to improve the selectivity of the results, common techniques allow the user to constrain the scope of the search to a specified subset of the database, or to provide additional search terms. These techniques are most effective in cases where the database is homogeneous and already classified into subsets, or in cases where the user is searching for well known and specific information. In other cases, however, these techniques are often not effective because each constraint introduced by the user increases the chances that the desired information will be inadvertently eliminated from the search results.
