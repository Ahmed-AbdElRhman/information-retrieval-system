Search engines presently use various techniques that attempt to present more relevant documents. Typically, documents are ranked according to variations of a standard vector space model. These variations could include (a) how recently the document was updated, and/or (b) how close the search terms are to the beginning of the document. Although this strategy provides search results that are better than with no ranking at all, the results still have relatively low quality. Moreover, when searching the highly competitive web, this measure of relevancy is vulnerable to “spamming” techniques that authors can use to artificially inflate their document's relevance in order to draw attention to it or its advertisements. For this reason search results often contain commercial appeals that should not be considered a match to the query. Although search engines are designed to avoid such ruses, poorly conceived mechanisms can result in disappointing failures to retrieve desired information.
